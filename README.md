# SmartAlarm
> *SmartAlarm* is an Android alarm clock application that does not only wake You up, but also makes You get up to disable the alarm by scanning the QR Code.

## General info
No more oversleeping with *SmartAlarm*! Download the default QR code and print it, or scan Your own, put it in a place remote from Your bed, turn on the alarm and prepare for a more productive morning! SmartAlarm will make You not only wake up, but also get up to actually turn off the alarm (unless You make the alarm snooze).
